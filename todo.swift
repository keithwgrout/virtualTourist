 When a photo album view is opened for a pin that does not yet have any photos, does it begin to download images from Flickr?

 i have the photo url, now i need to send a request to flickr with the url to get a photo returned
 
 i have the photo data.
 
 
 1. setup a bbox property inside PAVC
 2. click on annotation in MVC
 3. create BBOX in MVC
 4. prepareForSegue from MVC, pass BBox to bbox property in PAVC
 5. call flickrClient.getphotos inside PAVC, passing in bbox
 
 
 6. when i have photos, show them in the collection view
 61. Figure out how to download photos without making 250 requests
 62. Look into subclassing
 
 
 
 
 7. store the photos to core data
